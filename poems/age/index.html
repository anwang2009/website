let's grow old together<br/>
<br/>
I'll work out so that<br/>
when you're down<br/>
I'll pick you up<br/>
and princess-carry you<br/>
and swing you around<br/>
and <br/>
you'll be laughing<br/>
<br/>
you'll stand bemusedly at my side as<br/>
I play-act <br/>
I yell at the kids to<br/>
get.<br/>
off.<br/>
my.<br/>
lawn<br/>
you little delinquents your<br/>
dirty little feet are ruining my sod<br/>
stop laughing--<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
when those delinquents<br/>
have some of their own to contend with<br/>
I'll buy a few words<br/>
embossed on a park bench<br/>
and sit with the memory of you,<br/>
laughing<br/>
